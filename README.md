##First independent code review project for Epicodus
This project consists of personal landing page for my portfolio. This will be my first code review for Epicodus and will allow me to display the skills I have learned in the first four weeks of my intro to coding class.

#The most current index.html is in the gh-pages not the master branch. I accidentally merged two pages in one branch and they were duplicated on the same html. I spent hours trying to fix it. I lost a little bit of the original design, but I fixed it enough for now. 

#Set up Instructions
Access index.html at [My Personal Portfolio](https://linjojesan.github.io/Portfolio-landing-page-epicodus/)
